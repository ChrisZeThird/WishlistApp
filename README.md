# WishlistApp
A Wishlist you can run as an exe or from your code editor directly. To access the `exe` just dowload the directory at [this adress](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RS3dxx9Y1H719w0YxwBrhbbdIFyD4Cmb?usp=sharing), make sure you keep it that way and don't remove the file of the logo. Otherwise it won't work. The files were too big to be put directly on github sadly so I had to use a Good Drive link.
