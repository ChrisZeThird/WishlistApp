# WishlistApp
A Wishlist you can run as an exe or from your code editor directly. To access the `exe` just dowload the directory at [this adress](https://github.com/ChrisZeThird/WishlistApp/releases/download/v1.21.11.22/WishList.rar), make sure you keep it that way and don't remove the file of the logo. Otherwise it won't work. 

Feel free to share your feedbacks on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/TcwjZhE)! I would be very happy to hear your suggestions!
